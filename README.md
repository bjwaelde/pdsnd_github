Git project and README created 7/5/2019.  This is a second attempt at submission.

### Project Title
Bikeshare for Udacity - Student Submission

### Description

This was created for a Udacity programming course.  It is an interactive Python program that runs in the command prompt that allows users to filter and browse ride data from a bikesharing program.  Users can select the city and add optional filters by month of year and day of week. The program returns descriptive statistics and allows the user to browse the raw data.

### Files used
The 2biketry.py program contains the code.
Source data is in .csv files: washingon.csv, new_york_city.csv, and chicago.csv.

### Credits

The template for the .py file was created by Udacity and already contained the basic structure and most of the docstrings.  Stack Overflow was consulted for various specifications of interest to the programmer and not covered in the Udacity course. See the code comments for more information.
Advice to add .gitignore to remote repository and guidance on using the style guide for commitment messages was provided by the first Udacity reviewer.
